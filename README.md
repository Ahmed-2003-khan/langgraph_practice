# LangGraph Practice

This repository contains my practice projects and experiments with LangGraph.

## About

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. This repository serves as my learning playground for exploring LangGraph concepts and implementations.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (when available)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contents

This repository will contain various LangGraph examples and practice projects as I learn and experiment with the framework.
