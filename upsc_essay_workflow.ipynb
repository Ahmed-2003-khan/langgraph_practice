The vocabulary is varied and appropriate, and the structure flows logically from the introduction of the topic to the conclusion. However, the essay could benefit from more specific examples to support the points made, particularly regarding challenges posed by technology. Additionally, some sentences can be phrased more dynamically to enhance engagement, and the conclusion could be strengthened by outlining actionable steps that individuals or societies can take. Overall, the language quality is strong but lacks depth in supporting arguments.'"
